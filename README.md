# FizzBuzzPrime

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/AIphaVictor/FizzBuzzPrime.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/AIphaVictor/FizzBuzzPrime)

Much like a regular fizzbuzz solution, this program prints "fizz" and "buzz" to standard out to indicate multiples of 3 and 5.

However, it also prints out "prime" in cases where the number is prime.

The number 3 is "fizzprime", and the number 5 is "buzzprime", but no number can be "fizzbuzzprime".
